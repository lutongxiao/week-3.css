    <p class="uppercase">The anniversary celebration is an opportunity for the GSA to demonstrate how it has changed over the past two decades, showcase recent initiatives and share its vision for the future.

        The GSA will discuss its recent organizational redesign that restructured the executive team and created two new full-time staff roles — an executive director and an office and health plan administrator — to align with the association’s non-for-profit incorporation status and replace the longtime office co-ordinator position.
